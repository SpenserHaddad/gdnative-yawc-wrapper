"""Download the requsted version of GodotSteam to use for Brotato development.

GodotSteam is a fork of Godot that includes various hooks for the Steam API. This was
originally the only version of Godot that worked for Brotato, since it was originally
released on Steam only. The main version of Godot should work for Brotato now too, but
for simplicity and consistency I still prefer to use the Steam version, especially since
that's what most people use.

The version should be a release tag on
https://codeberg.org/godotsteam/godotsteam/releases/. Brotato uses a Godot 3.6 tag,
so don't try settings this to latest ;).

You also need to provide the full version

This script first checks if the requested version is downloaded, and does nothing if so,
unless the "-f/--force" flag is set. We write a custom file, "godot_version.json", to the
output directory with the version requested, which is queried to make this check.
